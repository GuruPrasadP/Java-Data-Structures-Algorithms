Write a program that takes encoded.txt as input and outputs the European language that it is in. It is one of these languages:
http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequenciesvarious-languages/

Put the text through your Huffman frequency code to get a frequency profile, and then compare it against these European languages to see which one is the best match. Come up with some metric for quantifying how good the fit is.

encrypt.java shows how the ciphertext was generated.
